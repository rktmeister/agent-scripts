# /handoff

Args: optional extra notes / emphasis in `$@`.

Purpose: package the current state so the next agent (or future you) can resume quickly.

Include (in order):
1) Scope/status: what you were doing, what’s done, what’s pending, blockers.
2) Working tree: `git status -sb` summary; note any local commits not pushed.
3) Branch/PR/CI: current branch, relevant PR number/URL, CI status if known.
4) Running processes: list tmux sessions/panes and how to attach:
   - `tmux attach -t <session>`
   - `tmux capture-pane -p -J -t <session>:0.0 -S -200`
5) Tests/checks: which commands were run, results, and what still needs to run.
6) Next steps: ordered bullets the next agent should do first.
7) Risks/gotchas: flaky tests, credentials, feature flags, brittle areas.

Output format: concise bullet list.
