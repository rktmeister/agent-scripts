description: Double check / critique implementation plan with fresh eyes
---
Great, now I want you to carefully read over the plan/spec and compare against the codebase with "fresh eyes," looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues, confusion, etc. Also double check that the patterns and coding styles match existing codebase conventions and preferences. Consider whether there is any unnecessary complexity or duplication, or if the changes can be more minimal without changing scope of requirements and without causing regressions or increasing the risk of bugs. Also keep in mind that this is not an MVP - so don't skip anything. If any issues are found, proceed to fix them without being asked to do so.

**Response format:**
- If you find ANY issues: fix them, then list what you fixed. Do NOT say "no issues found" - instead end with "Fixed [N] issue(s). Ready for another review."
- If you find ZERO issues: respond with exactly "No issues found."
