description: Double check / review implementation with fresh eyes
---
Great, now I want you to carefully read over all of the new code you just wrote and other existing code with "fresh eyes," looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues, confusion, etc. Also, if you notice any pre-existing issues/bugs those should be addressed.

**Response format:**
- If you find ANY issues: fix them, then list what you fixed. Do NOT say "no issues found" - instead end with "Fixed [N] issue(s). Ready for another review."
- If you find ZERO issues: respond with exactly "No issues found."
